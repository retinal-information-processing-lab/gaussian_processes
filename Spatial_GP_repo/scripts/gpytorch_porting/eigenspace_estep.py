"""
E-Step for Eigenspace Variational GP

Implements Newton update for variational parameters (m_b, V_b) in the eigenspace
representation used by DirectVGPModel.

Key functions:
- estep_eigenspace: Newton update in eigenspace

Extracted from estep.py during codebase reorganization (2025-02).

def estep_eigenspace(model, r: torch.Tensor, f_mean: torch.Tensor) -> None:
    """Newton update for variational parameters in eigenspace.

    This implementation matches utils.py:Estep() lines 4244-4256 exactly.
    Runs entirely under torch.no_grad() — the Newton update is closed-form
    and never needs autograd. Without no_grad, the computation graph chains
    through A (which has requires_grad) and causes unbounded memory growth.

    The g_b and G_b computed here are the TRANSFORMED versions:
        g_b = K_tilde_inv @ g_standard
        G_b = K_tilde_inv @ G_standard @ K_tilde_inv

    The formulas below are correct for these transformed quantities.

    TODO: INVESTIGATE - The m_new formula here matches the old code but may have
    a mathematical discrepancy. See .claude/ESTEP_MATH_ANALYSIS.md for analysis.
    The correct formula would be: m_new = m + K_tilde @ solve(K_tilde + G, g - m)
    But the old code uses: m_new = V_new @ (G @ m + g)
    These differ unless K_tilde and G commute. Worth investigating if the
    "correct" formula improves results.
