"""
Shared Evaluation Metrics for GP Models

This module contains evaluation metrics used by both eigenspace and default_gpy
implementations. These are pure functions with no mode-specific dependencies.

Functions:
- compute_r_squared: R² coefficient of determination
- compute_pearson_correlation: Pearson correlation coefficient
- compute_explained_variance: Explained variance (correlation ratio, NOT the paper's adjusted R²)
- compute_adjusted_r_squared: Adjusted R² from Goldin et al. 2023 PNAS, Eq. 5

Extracted from train.py during codebase reorganization (2025-02).

    Based on the Spearman-Brown correction: the observed correlation between
    prediction and noisy response is attenuated by sqrt(reliability). Dividing
    by sqrt(reliability) recovers the correlation with the true (noise-free)
    signal. Squaring gives the fraction of true signal variance explained.

    A value of 1.0 means the model explains all signal variance given the
    noise ceiling. Always >= 0 by construction (squared ratio).

    ratio (not squared) and divides by reliability (not sqrt):
